# Prime

> Execute every section below, then summarize your understanding.

## Step 1: Project tree

!`git ls-files`

## Step 2: Read the project rulebook

Read the file `CLAUDE.md` in the project root. This is the authoritative reference for conventions, rules, tech stack, and development commands.

## Step 3: Read the project roadmap

Read `specs/roadmap.md` to understand the full project plan, layer status, and what's in progress.

## Step 4: Summarize

Provide a structured summary:

1. **Project purpose** — what this application does
2. **Tech stack** — frontend, backend, database, auth
3. **Key conventions** — coding style, hard rules, architectural constraints
4. **Current state** — which layers are complete, what's in progress
5. **Project structure** — main directories and their purposes
6. **Development workflow** — how to build, test, and run
